```javascript
import Link from 'next/link';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href="/">
        <a>Home</a>
      </Link>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>About</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
This code snippet uses Next.js's Link component to create navigation links. However, if you encounter a runtime error that is difficult to track down, particularly when working with dynamic routes or data fetching, it might be related to unexpected behavior of the Link component when combined with other features, like dynamic imports or client-side routing.
