# Next.js Link Component Runtime Error

This repository demonstrates a potential runtime error related to Next.js's `Link` component. The error is particularly subtle and difficult to debug, especially when dealing with dynamic routes or data fetching. This example showcases the issue and provides a possible solution.

## Problem

The original code (in `bug.js`) uses the Next.js `Link` component for navigation. However, under certain circumstances, particularly when combined with dynamic imports or client-side routing, this can lead to unexpected behavior and runtime errors that may not immediately point to the root cause. These errors can manifest as unexpected page behavior, missing data, or more cryptic runtime exceptions.

## Solution

The solution (in `bugSolution.js`) demonstrates a potential approach to resolve the issue. It focuses on ensuring consistent data handling and potentially includes additional error handling and logging that can be helpful for identifying and addressing issues.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.
5. Try interacting with the links. Note any unexpected behavior.
